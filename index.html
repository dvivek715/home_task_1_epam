                    Explosions shook Russian-occupied cities in southern Ukraine, injuring a police chief and hitting a military facility, while a Russian missile strike killed at least two people and injured 29 others in the eastern city of Slovyansk, Ukrainian officials said.

The explosions on Monday came as front lines in the east and south were largely deadlocked.</b>

                    With over 2,800 kilometres under his belt, Mr Gandhi has managed to catch the attention of his supporters as well as detractors.
